   cancel this. for now let's see the polar plot as an 'output' only
   otherwise ends up recursively updating between plot and table
 ☐ Use the side bar table to filter the plot and produce a detailed summary of the patient
   ✔ move the side bar to the left so it acts like a menu @done (21-11-17 00:03)
   ☐ add in a detailed 'card' with the rest of the info below the plot
 ☐ TODO: create a skeleton structure for each ward to permit 'blanks'
 ☐ TODO: break down bed list into functional units: will require some structure to beds 
   e.g. North/South/PACU
   then you be able to filter by these units
   will need to instantiate a database for this
   ?sqlite for portability
