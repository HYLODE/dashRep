   cancel this. for now let's see the polar plot as an 'output' only
   otherwise ends up recursively updating between plot and table
 ✔ Use the side bar table to filter the plot and produce a detailed summary of the patient @done (21-11-18 23:34)
   ✔ move the side bar to the left so it acts like a menu @done (21-11-17 00:03)

 ☐ TODO: adapt plot to present empty circles or similar for empty beds
   set up a better colour scheme and position approach
   suggest thinking about colour = discharge status (green = empty, amber = review, shades of red LoS)
   then maybe wim is zero if empty
 ☐ TODO: break down bed list into functional units: will require some structure to beds 
 ☐ TODO: tidy readme, explain config and set-up
 ✔ TODO: nested columns for widgets https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/layout/grid/ @done (21-11-19 09:12)
 ☐ TODO: left table to single column and active cell to select as easier mouse target
 ☐ FIXME: fix the problem with the plot being drawn behind layout objects below it
   e.g. North/South/PACU
   then you be able to filter by these units
   will need to instantiate a database for this
   ?sqlite for portability
 ☐ TODO: re-insert the CRUD functionality
 ☐ TODO: functionality to indicate in side bar d/c status (yes/review/no)
   then add in a place to insert estimated admissions
   then a bar to show final occupancy
 ☐ TODO: ask Jon/Nel to help me wire this up to HYLODE with a postgres or similar backend
 ☐ TODO: then bring in Zella's predictions and source data
