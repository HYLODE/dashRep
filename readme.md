comparing streamlit to dash and I don't think that streamlit is mature enough
dash is well documented and comes with a lot of the features that I would have to build myself

build a dash version of the sitrep dashboard

stage 1
connect to the API that Nel exposes
read data
present data

stage 2
a visual layout

stage 3
cross filter so selection on the visual layout
then filters the table holding the patient details

stage 4
make that table editable
